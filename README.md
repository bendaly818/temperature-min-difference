# Technical Test for Theta by Ben Daly

The task of this test is to use C#/Python create an app which will return the day number of the day with the lowest difference in min and max temperature given a set of weather data

I have chosen to write this in Python (Version 3.7.1)

## Usage:

Run the weather.py file in the command line

To change the input file, simply change the filepath value to your desired dataset

I have included a few modified versions of the original weather.dat file for testing purposes, feel free to have a look at them to see what I was testing for

The code is quite well documented so it shouldn't be too hard to understand what I am doing to produce the result

This is by no means the perfect solution, there are definately things I would add such as more robust error handling to catch all the edge cases
